the drawback of pypy is you need to install all new packages that are not always supported, only the basic ones are

it seems that pypy packages are tough to install for windows: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67357758/how-to-install-numpy-in-pypy-on-windows

but this is a workaround: https://coderedirect.com/questions/84626/installing-numpy-with-pip-on-windows-10-for-python-3-7

i manually downloaded numpy-1.21.5+mkl-pp38-pypy38_pp73-win_amd64.whl and did pypy -m pip install numpy-1.21.5+mkl-pp38-pypy38_pp73-win_amd64.whl and it worked

but ultimately it appears that PyPy is slower, which was said online:
-pypy can increase speed for non numpy
-but if there is numpy in it in will def only be the same, or worse
the speed decrease is significant though: 4.5x slower than normal python
especially get_path_moves, which relies heavily on numpy, is a lot slower
